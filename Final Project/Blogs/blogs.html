		  <h3>Sixties Soul Ride</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">MusicLover001</p>
		  <p><span>
			  I have recently been getting into music from the 60's, specifically
			  60's blues, and have been listening to a wide range of artists from that
			  time. My favorite by far has to be The Mad Lads. My favorite song by them is
			  titled, "So Nice". My favorite parts about the song are its mellow sounding
			  rhythm section, and the harmonies done by the vocals. This song was a single
			  released in 1968. The Mad Lads only released one other song this year. This 
			  song is titled "Whatever Hurts You". I also enjoyed this song, but I still 
			  prefer the sound that "So Nice" has better. I would certainly recommend 
			  starting with The Mad Lads if you are wanting to get into 60's blues.

		  <h3>Revisiting 2012 Pop</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">iLoveMusic201</p>
		  <p><span>
			  After 12 years, I decided to revist some of the the top charts from
			  2012. I remember the music from this time being energetic and
			  danceable, as well as some of the most iconic songs and albums being 
			  from this era. Albums such as <em>Take Me Home</em> by One Direction, 
			  <em>Red</em> by Taylor Swift, <em>Born to Die</em> by Lana Del Rey,
			  and <em>Teenage Dream</em> by Katy Perry just to name a few. When I 
			  revisited these albums, as well as a few others, I was surprised to
			  find that I still had some of the lyrics memorized! Listening to them 
			  also took me back to when they had just released and were all over
			  the radio. Such good times!

		  <h3>The Classics</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">gorillazFan</p>
		  <p><span>
			  I had always wanted to give classical music a try as it was something
			  that I don't really listen to. I found some famous composers and 
			  began to listen to their songs. I started with Claude Debussy and
			  almost instantly, I was blown away. I had realized that I have heard
			  a few songs by him before, such as "Clair de Lune". I continued to 
			  listen and found one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.
			  The song is "2 Arabesques No. 1". The soft yet moving melody at the 
			  beginning immediately caught my attention and instantly, I was in
			  love with the song. The song then slows down a bit, but then picks
			  back up again in tempo and builds up to another slower part. It
			  repeats this sort of fast and slow dance throughout the song, and
			  executes it beautifully each time. The last minute and 30 seconds of
			  the song sounds similar to the beginning, and ends with the light and
			  airy melody it began with. Such a wonderful song that changed my view
			  on classical music!

		  <h3>Country Recommendations?</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">eagerEnceladus</p>
		  <p><span>
		    Hi everyone, I'm here trying to seek out country music 
			recommendations. I have never been able to get into the genre no
			matter how many times I have tried. I might not be looking in the 
			right places to find country music that I actually might like, so
			if anyone has any song recommendations that they'd like to share,
			or any recommendations on where to even start, that would be
			greatly appreciated.

		  <h3>Hip-hop here!</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">partyRockin247</p>
		  <p><span>
		    If you're feeling like listening to some hip-hip lately, look no 
			further than Joey Valence & Brae. They are an awesom hip-hip duo
			who make super catchy beats! I love to listen to their songs while
			I clean or just when I feel like vibing to something with a beat. 
			I would highly recommend listening to their album, <em>Punk Tactics
			</em> which has some of my favorites by them. The favorites from
			this album are "DELINQUENT (TEEN TITAN)", "STARTAFIGHT", and
			"GUMDROP". All three are super groovy and are great for anyone
			looking for some new hip-hop music.

		  <h3>Rock solid Rock</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">coolPianist</p>
		  <p><span>
		    My favorite rock songs come from the late 70's or early 80's. I 
			remember hearing a lot of these songs as I was growing up because
			they were what my mom grew up with as a kid. A lot of these songs
			have grown to become really popular and I love hearing them at
			parties, or even in the grocery store. Songs like "Jessie's Girl",
			"Don't Stop Me Now", and "Don't Stop Believin'" are some of my
			favorites that I tend to hear pretty often. While rock is not my
			favorite genre of music, it's always great to listen to and brings 
			back good memories!

		  <h3>Jazz Listening</h3>
		  <p class="userTag">mercuryRetro</p>
		  <p><span>
		    Jazz is one of my favorite genres! While jazz is a very broad
			genre, it's also what makes it so special! Swing is probably the 
			most popular and well known genre. This is thanks to the many
			artists who helped make swing popular, like Duke Ellington and
			Count Basie. Both are incredibly talented musicians who have made
			such a lasting impact on jazz. Bossa Nova is another one of my
			favorite styles of jazz, and people like Jo√£o Gilberto and Stan
			Getz have made some of the most popular Bossa Nova songs. "The Girl
			From Ipanema" and "Desafinado" are both popular songs by both of
			them that comes from their joint album, <em>Getz/Gilberto</em>.
			Jazz is a wonderful genre with so much history and culture behind
			it. I believe that there is something out there for everyone when
			it comes to jazz!
