				<p>Any attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile. Jazz has been, 
				from its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase—for instance, to New Orleans style or swing—becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free jazz.
				</p> 
				<p>Early attempts to define jazz as a music whose chief characteristic was improvisation, for example, turned out to be too restrictive and largely untrue, since composition, arrangement, and ensemble have also been essential components of jazz for most of its history. Similarly, syncopation and swing, often considered essential and unique to jazz, are in fact lacking in much authentic jazz, whether of the 1920s or of later decades. Again, the long-held notion that swing could not occur without syncopation was roundly disproved when trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bunny Berigan (among others) frequently generated enormous swing while playing repeated, unsyncopated quarter notes.</p>
				<p>Jazz, in fact, is not—and never has been—an entirely composed, predetermined music, nor is it an entirely extemporized one. For almost all of its history it has employed both creative approaches in varying degrees and endless permutations. And yet, despite these diverse terminological confusions, jazz seems to be instantly recognized and distinguished as something separate from all other forms of musical expression. To repeat Armstrong’s famous reply when asked what swing meant: “If you have to ask, you’ll never know.”</p>

                <h3>Origins</h3>
				
                <p>“When was jazz music created?” is a question many jazz fans and people new to the genre ask. The beginnings of 
				jazz actually date back to the 19th century. New Orleans was home to Congo Square, a space where slaves would gather and play music. That tradition started a bit before 1820, and it 
				brought together people from a wide array of countries, each introducing a bit of their nation’s unique sound to the 
				mix.</p>
				
				<p>Over time, the blending of African music and Caribbean music was joined by marching band instruments. Marching bands were highly prevalent during the Civil War. They introduced many people to various brass instruments, and the united sound eventually formed the genre known as ragtime.</p>

				<p>Spiritual music was also popular during the era and made its way into what ultimately became the jazz sound. After the Civil War, formerly enslaved people from throughout the American south brought blues to Louisiana. In time, all of these sounds melded together, leading to the genre that became jazz.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, exactly when the genre known as jazz began is a bit debated. Most feel it started in the late 1800s or early 1900s. However, it ultimately rose to fame in the 1920s.</p>

                <h3>Styles</h3>
					<h4>Early Jazz</h4>
					<p>Early Jazz, also known as “Hot Jazz” or “Dixieland Music”, was typically played by small groups of musicians in intimate settings. This style of Jazz is often characterized by its relaxed and spontaneous feel, as well as its inventive solos and improvisations based on melodies.</p>
				
					<h4>Big Band and Swing Music</h4>
					<p>The 1940s brought about the big band and swing music era in Jazz. This type of Jazz is characterized by its up-tempo tempos, lush orchestration, and improvisational solos. Some of the biggest names in big band and swing music include Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and Artie Shaw.</p>

					<h4>Bebop</h4>
					<p>If you’re interested in Jazz, you’ve probably heard of bebop. Developed in the 1940s, bebop is one of the most popular and influential styles of jazz music. Characterized by fast tempos, intricate melodies, and harmonic improvisation, bebop is known for its challenging nature and often dense sound. Musicians who play bebop typically have a firm grasp of jazz theory and can improvise in various styles.</p>
				
					<h4>Cool Jazz</h4>
					<p>You might be wondering, what Is Cool Jazz? Cool Jazz is a type of Jazz that emerged in the 1940s and 50s and is characterized by its mellower sound and slower tempo. Cool Jazz artists often use muted trumpets and mellow saxophones, creating a more subdued sound than traditional Jazz. Some of the most famous Cool Jazz artists include Chet Baker, Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. If you’re looking for a more chilled-out jazz experience, give Cool Jazz a try!</p>
				
					<h4>Modal Jazz</h4>
					<p>In a nutshell, Modal Jazz is a type of Jazz that uses modal harmony instead of chord progressions. This means that the musician uses scales to create melodies instead of chords, which gives the music a more discordant and atonal sound. One of the pioneers of modal Jazz was Miles Davis, who released his seminal album “Kind of Blue” in 1959. The album was a huge success and helped to popularize the style among other jazz musicians. Since then, Modal Jazz has been adopted by many musicians and evolved into various sub-styles.</p>
				
					<h4>Fusion</h4>
					<p>You may have noticed that Jazz is a pretty diverse style of music. And that’s because it has evolved over the years to include several different styles and sub-genres. One of the most popular and versatile sub-genres is fusion. Fusion jazz is a mix of Jazz with other genres, like rock, funk, soul, or Latin music. This creates a familiar and new sound that can be tailored to fit any mood or occasion. Fusion artists often experiment with new sounds and instruments, so it’s always exciting to see what they come up with next.</p>
				
					<h4>Modern Jazz</h4>
					<p>Modern Jazz is a type of Jazz that incorporates elements of funk, soul and R&B into the traditional jazz sound. It emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is still popular today. Some of the biggest names in modern Jazz are Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and Sylvia Brooks. Their music is often described as “cool” and “cerebral” and has hugely influenced subsequent generations of jazz artists.</p>

                <h3>Key Artists</h3>
                <p>Key figures in the history of jazz include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane.</p>
					<h4>Louis Armstrong</h4>
					<p>Louis Armstrong’s monumental contributions to jazz music make him one of the most influential jazz musicians to ever live. 
					Referred to as “Pops” or “Satchmo,” Armstrong’s vibrant spirit and groundbreaking artistry have left an enduring legacy, making him an American icon.Before Armstrong’s influence, the jazz played in New Orleans emphasized collective improvisation. Louis, however, brought the soloist to the forefront and highlighted individual expression within the ensemble.</p>

					<h4>Duke Ellington</h4>
					<p>Duke Ellington’s approach to music was characterized by elegance, innovation, and a deep connection to the socio-cultural heartbeat of the 20th century. His vast body of swing music and jazz compositions continues to inspire generations of musicians and listeners. Over his lifetime, Duke Ellington wrote more than 3,000 compositions! His works ranged from short ballads to extended suites, all of which showcased his skills as a composer and his orchestra’s skills as one of the best big bands in the New York jazz scene.</p>
					
					<h4>Miles Davis</h4>
					<p>Few jazz musicians have broken into the mainstream like Miles Davis. As a jazz musician, Miles Davis remains a symbol of innovation. He constantly reinvented himself and refused to be defined by any single era or jazz genre. As a band leader, Miles Davis is responsible for discovering and nurturing young jazz talent throughout his career. Throughout his long career as a jazz artist, Miles was known for being at the forefront of multiple jazz movements, from bebop to fusion. His uncanny ability to reinvent himself musically is unmatched.</p>
					
					<h4>John Coltrane</h4>
					<p>John Coltrane is one of the most sonically recognizable jazz artists of all time. A true jazz musician among many great jazz musicians on this list, his relentless pursuit of musical and spiritual depth makes him an enduring and revered jazz artist among fellow jazz musicians and regular listeners. From bebop to avant-garde, John Coltrane constantly evolved as a jazz musician. He relentlessly pursued his artistic identity as a jazz musician, moving through different phases of musical exploration in a relatively short career that started in the years after World War II and lasted into the 60s. Coltrane’s innovative approach to the saxophone, with his blistering speed, complex patterns, and “sheets of sound,” makes him a contender for the most influential jazz saxophonist in the history of jazz.</p>
