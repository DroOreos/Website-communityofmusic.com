				<p>
				Rock is a form of popular music that emerged in the 1950s. It is certainly arguable that by the end of the 20th century rock was the world’s dominant form of popular music. Originating in the United States in the 1950s, it spread to other English-speaking countries and across Europe in the ’60s, and by the ’90s its impact was obvious globally (if in many different local guises). Rock’s commercial importance was by then reflected in the organization of the multinational recording industry, in the sales racks of international record retailers, and in the playlist policies of music radio and television. If other kinds of music—classical, jazz, easy listening, country, folk, etc.—are marketed as minority interests, rock defines the musical mainstream. And so over the last half of the 20th century it became the most inclusive of musical labels—everything can be “rocked”—and in consequence the hardest to define. To answer the question, What is rock?, one first has to understand where it came from and what made it possible. And to understand rock’s cultural significance, one has to understand how it works socially as well as musically.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Dictionary definitions of rock are problematic, not least because the term has different resonance in its British and American usages (the latter is broader in compass). There is basic agreement that rock “is a form of music with a strong beat,” but it is difficult to be much more explicit. The Collins Cobuild English Dictionary, based on a vast database of British usage, suggests that “rock is a kind of music with simple tunes and a very strong beat that is played and sung, usually loudly, by a small group of people with electric guitars and drums,” but there are so many exceptions to this description that it is practically useless.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Legislators seeking to define rock for regulatory purposes have not done much better. The Canadian government defined “rock and rock-oriented music” as “characterized by a strong beat, the use of blues forms and the presence of rock instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric organ or electric piano.” This assumes that rock can be marked off from other sorts of music formally, according to its sounds. In practice, though, the distinctions that matter for rock fans and musicians have been ideological. Rock was developed as a term to distinguish certain music-making and listening practices from those associated with pop; what was at issue was less a sound than an attitude. In 1990 British legislators defined pop music as “all kinds of music characterized by a strong rhythmic element and a reliance on electronic amplification for their performance.” This led to strong objections from the music industry that such a definition failed to appreciate the clear sociological difference between pop (“instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers”) and rock (“album-based music for adults”). In pursuit of definitional clarity, the lawmakers misunderstood what made rock music matter.

                <h3>Origins</h3>
				
                <p>
				Rock’s origins can be traced to the late 1940s, when the popular styles of the day, country music and blues, morphed into a new sound aided by electric guitars and a steady drumbeat. Pioneering rock artists of the 1950s such as Chuck Berry leaned heavily on classic blues structures while demonstrating a flair as natural-born entertainers. In contrast to the safe pop music of the era, rock’s aggressive attack suggested a sexual freedom that was shocking during that conservative age. By the early '60s, Berry’s followers, most notably the Rolling Stones, expanded rock’s scope by transitioning from singles artists into musicians capable of producing cohesive albums of songs. Embracing sex and youthful rebellion in their music, the Stones courted controversy but also elevated rock to new cultural heights.

				As rock music became the dominant form of popular music, new bands built on their predecessors’ strengths while branching out into new sonic territory. Led Zeppelin gave rock a darker, heavier tone, becoming one of the '70s’ most popular bands and helping to kick-start a new genre known as hard rock or heavy metal. Around the same time, Pink Floyd added psychedelic elements and complex arrangements, creating concept albums tied together by a single theme and meant to be absorbed in a single sitting. Albums such as "Dark Side of the Moon" were credited with spawning the progressive rock movement. In the late '70s, in response to what they perceived as pretentious “hippie” bands such as Pink Floyd, groups including the Sex Pistols and the Clash simplified rock to its core ingredients: loud guitars, rude attitude, and enraged singing. Punk was born. While all three movements enjoyed different degrees of mainstream acceptance, a fourth, less-recognized style was beginning to take shape. Spotlighting atonal noise and unconventional rock instruments such as drum machines, groups such as Pere Ubu became the pioneers of industrial rock, an abrasive subgenre that didn’t enjoy widespread popularity but inspired future rock bands.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				As the '80s began, mainstream rock was losing commercial steam, its sound growing stale. In such a creatively stagnant environment, subgenres started to assert their dominance. Inspired by punk’s outsider status and industrial’s eclectic instrumentation, keyboard-driven English bands such as Depeche Mode demonstrated a more introverted songwriting style, creating post-punk, also described as new wave. Meanwhile, American groups including R.E.M. toyed with post-punk elements, balancing introspective lyrics with traditional rock-band arrangements. These bands were dubbed college rock because of their popularity on college radio stations. By the end of the '80s, college rock had become such a lucrative alternative to mainstream rock that it received a new moniker: alternative rock. It was also called indie rock because the bands were often signed to small, independently owned labels. Alternative rock cemented its cultural standing when the music magazine Billboard created a new chart in 1988 for alternative rock, which the publication classified as modern rock. For most music fans, terms such as modern rock, alternative, and indie are synonymous ways of describing this popular subgenre.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				With the ascension of Nirvana's "Nevermind" in 1991, alternative rock became the dominant popular music. But while other bands soon sprang up as part of the so-called grunge movement (a merging of hard rock and punk), other groups, such as Soundgarden, straddled the worlds of alternative and mainstream rock music. Exacerbated by the suicide of Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain, alternative music started to lose its luster by the middle of the decade, setting the stage for mainstream rock's reemergence. One of the first bands to capitalize on mainstream rock’s comeback was Limp Bizkit, which melded hard rock and rap into a hybrid call rap-rock. Groups such as Staind and Puddle of Mudd followed in Limp Bizkit’s wake, though these bands focused on melodic hard rock rather than integrating rap into the mix. Bands that had thrived during grunge’s heyday but didn’t easily fit into the alternative subgenre, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, continued to find audiences throughout the '90s. Additionally, groups that rose from the ashes of grunge, among them Foo Fighters, incorporated alternative music’s outsider energy to re-energize mainstream rock. As rock music entered the 21st century, the most successful acts had the same spirit as their '60s predecessors, even if they sounded quite different. Linkin Park fuses hip-hop and metal, while 3 Doors Down emulates hard-rock traditions of the past while providing a contemporary spin. Undoubtedly, rock music will keep evolving, drawing from its rich history while continuing to keep its ear open for the next sonic reinvention.

					</p>

                <h3>Key Artists</h3>
            
					<h4>Elvis Presley</h4>
					<p>
					Elvis Presley, from Memphis, Tennessee, personified a new form of American popular music in the mid-1950s. Rock and roll was a guitar-based sound with a strong (if loose) beat that drew equally on African American and white traditions from the southern United States, on blues, church music, and country music. Presley’s rapid rise to national stardom revealed the new cultural and economic power of both teenagers and teen-aimed media—records, radio, television, and motion pictures.
					</p>

					<h4>The Beatles</h4>
					<p>
					The Beatles, from Liverpool, England (via Hamburg, Germany), personified a new form of British popular music in the 1960s. Merseybeat was a British take on the Black and white musical mix of rock and roll: a basic lineup of lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, and drums (with shared vocals) provided local live versions of American hit records of all sorts. The Beatles added to this an artistic self-consciousness, soon writing their own songs and using the recording studio to develop their own—rather than a commercial producer’s—musical ideas. The group’s unprecedented success in the United States ensured that rock would be an Anglo-American phenomenon.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
					<p>
					Bob Dylan, from Hibbing, Minnesota (via New York City), personified a new form of American music in the mid-1960s. Dylan brought together the amplified beat of rock and roll, the star imagery of pop, the historical and political sensibility of folk, and—through the wit, ambition, and obscurity of his lyrics—the arrogance of urban bohemia. He gave the emerging rock scene artistic weight (his was album, not Top 40, music) and a new account of youth as an ideological rather than a demographic category.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Jimi Hendrix</h4>
					<p>
					Jimi Hendrix, from Seattle, Washington (via London), personified the emergence of rock as a specific musical genre in the late 1960s. Learning his trade as a guitarist in rhythm-and-blues bands and possessing a jazzman’s commitment to collective improvisation, he came to fame leading a trio in London and exploring the possibilities of the amplifier as a musical instrument in the recording studio and on the concert stage. Hendrix established versatility and technical skill as a norm for rock musicianship and gave shape to a new kind of event: the outdoor festival and stadium concert, in which the noise of the audience became part of the logic of the music.
